        <h2>The Parable</h2>

        <p>
          Suppose an alien race comes to Earth and wants to observe our games.
          They are very interested in chess, despite the fact that they have
          eyes with properties that make it impossible to make out what actually
          happens on a chess board. (The whites and blacks and squares all blur
          together.)
        </p>

        <p>
          They can still learn about chess experimentally, they know they can
          sit two players (a so-called "white" and "black" player) down to play
          it, and they can tell behaviorally who at the end wins.
        </p>

        <p>
          After extensive experimentation, they realize this: 50% of the time,
          the white player wins and 50% of the time, the black player wins
          (we'll ignore draws and any first-move advantage for the example).
        </p>

        <h3>The "best" model</h3>

        <p>
          A logical positivist alien thus creates the ultimate, long-term model
          of chess as an iterated game: Chess amounts to just a drawn-out coin
          flip. Half of the time white wins, half of the time black wins, just
          as if they were tossing a quarter.
        </p>

        <p>
          The aliens then decide to model chess as a coin flip, as a 50-50 game
          with no underlying principles. While this statistical technique might
          not be useful for predicting a single game, over the long run and over
          iterated games,
          <em>it is the most efficient and parsimonious possible model</em>.
        </p>

        <h3>"Inferior" models</h3>

        <p>
          Suppose, however that a "crank" scientist of the alien race posits
          that "God doesn't play dice" and that chess is a more complicated
          game, despite the fact that the aliens cannot observe it. Suppose even
          he asks around and determines from humans that there are actually
          pieces on the board with functions, and he even devises a machine that
          allows his alien eyes to see the first move of the game of chess.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seeing this move allows him to create a new theory and model of the
          game, one that takes into account the first move made and he tries to
          generate a new set of probabilities of victory based on that move. The
          model he makes, is of course highly arbitrary, stipulated and
          <em>ad hoc</em>. In fact, this model is inferior on many inevitable
          accounts. For example:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            It is less predictive over iterated games than the coin flip model.
          </li>
          <li>It is not as parsimonious/minimal as the coin flip model.</li>
          <li>
            It adds new variables to the theory (pieces) that are suspect.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Which model is "right?"</h2>

        <h3>Which model is closer to truth?</h3>

        <p>
          Since we, unlike the aliens, are not prevented by defect from
          observing chess, we know that the second, "inferior" theory of chess
          is truer. Its theoretical categories, if apparently arbitrary in the
          eyes of the aliens, are getting at the actual underlying mechanics of
          chess. Even if the model is less effective, it is certainly
          <em>righter</em>.
        </p>

        <h3>Which will cause fruitful scientific inquiry?</h3>

        <p>
          The coin flip model is a scientific dead-end. Firstly, the coin flip
          model is constructed statistically, which presents the underlying
          mechanism to be randomness, and thus unworth of inquiry. This isn't
          statistics hoisted above random variation we know to exist, instead,
          it's utterly blind statistics that covers over whatever principles
          underlie it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Secondly and more importantly, in order to actually improve that
          model, it has to <em>lose</em> empirical solvency: embracing the
          abstractions of pieces means introducing mess and deviating in some
          way from the empircal generalization that half of all chess games are
          won by white and half by black.
        </p>

        <h3>This is not an abnormal circumstance.</h3>

        <p>
          The parable here, really an <em>example</em> is not abnormal. In most
          affairs in science, whether that be physics or neuroscience or
          economics or chemistry, we are exactly like the partially-blind
          aliens.
        </p>

        <h3>"But science isn't about truth!"</h3>

        <p>Yeah, it is dude.</p>

        <p>
          Even if you are pretending that science is about "models" or fitting
          equations and the like, again, the well-fit model is impossible to
          perfect, while the flawed, yet more true to reality model does have a
          potential over the long-term to be a superior one. After exhaustive
          inquiry, an alien race might not only discover the pieces and the full
          set of rules behind chess, they might be able to predict what moves
          are good or bad and predict individual chess games. Even on the
          standards of mere instrumentalism, the mindless positivistic theory is
          still actually inferior.
        </p>

        <h2>Local maxima</h2>

        <img
          class="max-width-img"
          src="./img/maximum.gif"
          alt="Local maximum"
        />

        <h3>The plot</h3>

        <p>
          One of the ways I visualize science and models is that each model is
          really like an n-dimensional optimization plot. "Truth," or if you
          deny truth as metaphysics, "accuracy in data" or "well-fit equations"
          are upwards and the goal of science is to get further that way.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the point you're at, you can tell which direction you can go to
          move upward, or, which little changes you can make to improve your
          model. That is what incremental science is, after all: don't change
          assumptions and just fine-tune your equations. The endless fine-tuning
          is sometimes thought of as "progress." Of course I don't think that
          this is
          <em>bad</em>, but it is a very minor and scientifically less important
          part of science as a whole.
        </p>

        <p>
          The reality of incremental science is that once you're at a local
          maximum, once you've fine-tuned your equations about as perfectly as
          possible, it's over. Everything next to you <em>looks</em> like a
          disimprovement. It <em>looks</em> just like those inferior theories of
          alien chess that posit the existence of pieces. From that, you might
          erroneously conclude that you have found the <em>global</em> maximum,
          which due to the nature of the complexity of the universe and the
          multiplicity of possible answers and theories, you flatly haven't.
        </p>

        <p>
          Logical positivism is kind of theoretical lobotomy that implicitly
          tells scientists that they should never, ever, ever change
          foundational assumptions: tweaking equations like an oblivious autist
          is Science®️ and everything else is "philosophy" or "metaphysics" or
          "pseudoscience." This amounts to keeping each scientific field on
          whatever local maximum is closest, utterly unable to extricate
          themselves from it even when they see on the horizon abberant data.
          <strong
            >If you want to understand the stagnation of science or any other
            specific field, this is where it comes from.</strong
          >
        </p>

        <h3>Purposefully "bad" science</h3>

        <p>
          In
          <i
            ><a

              >Against Method</a
            ></i
          >, Paul Feyerabend, in what an unreflective mind might misinterpret as
          a "troll," says that it is important for science that people have
          biases, financial interests, interfering religious and political
          doctrines and the like in science. Looking at the plot, you might now
          see why. When we are stuck on a local maximum, every new data keeps
          our already-optimized model where it is no matter how low that maximum
          actually is. What you need to shake it up is an external shock that
          totally moves our theoretical position somewhere new on the plot where
          we can try to optimize at another point, and then compare.
        </p>

        <h3>Basic assumptions</h3>

        <p>
          A prudent person should be able to question, "Am I even on the right
          track or am I playing with some model that has a fundamental flaw?" I
          can guarantee you, optimizing for data and fitting math and equations
          is easy.
          <strong
            >All theoretical programs are wrong because they make incorrect core
            assumptions.</strong
          >
          This is very hard for the ego of scientists because it means:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Possibly illiterate dilettantes on the internet might see and bring
            to attention legitimate theoretical flaws.
          </li>
          <li>
            All the years you spend in graduate school counting angels on
            pinheads in your respective theoretical framework is mostly a waste
            of time.
          </li>
          <li>
            The borders of science are borders more of a sociological club than
            being the border of raw rigor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Most of the scientific work is not meaningful outside of the
            theoretical framework that gave rise to it.
          </li>
